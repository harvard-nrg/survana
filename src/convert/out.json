You are asked to complete up to 30 distinct questionnaires, each of which contain a different number of questions on different topics, and up to 6 cognitive tasks. Please read the instructions and answer the questions carefully. Try to give answers without spending too much time on any single question. You will have specific instructions at the beginning of each questionnaire. Some of the questionnaires are related to your history of education, health, and occupation. Generally, questions are related to actions, situations, or psychological states that we all might experience in our daily lives. There are no right or wrong answers. Therefore, you should choose the option that you think best applies to you. <br><br>We would like you to give an answer to each question but if you wish not to answer a particular question for some reason, you may leave it unanswered or select “prefer not to answer”. Once you finish answering the questions on a page, please click the “Next” button on top of that page. If there are unanswered questions, those will be highlighted in yellow as a reminder to you. If you choose not to answer a question, you may skip that question by clicking the “Skip” button next to the warning message: “This field is missing”. It may take up to 2-2.5 hours to complete the study. <br><br>While completing the battery, you will receive breaks. Please make every effort to only take breaks during these allotted times. However, if you take long breaks while you're being tested, the study becomes inactive and won't allow you to finish. Each questionnaire is one page long. If you have to take a break before reaching a “take a break” screen, we ask that you fully complete the questionnaire you are currently working on and click “Next” to advance to the next questionnaire before taking a break. This is because some of the questions are personal in nature, and we do not want anyone to see your answers if you leave your computer. <br><br>When you finish a questionnaire click the “Next” button at the top of the page in order to advance to the following questionnaire. Once you have completed the last one and when you are ready to submit your answers, click the “Submit” button, which will appear on the page following the last questionnaire. Before continuing, please be sure that you are in a quiet place and are able to answer the questions confidentially, without distraction or interruption from another person. <br><br>Thank you for your participation in this study!</div>"}],"display_title":true,"gid":"NHbJvW","group":"Instructions","id":"jctTCH","published":true,"title":"Instructions","version":"InstGC"}
